- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sulaiman Satar
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of technology and society, particularly how emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and Internet of Things (IoT) are reshaping the way we live, work, and interact. Beyond the technical aspects, I'm keen on exploring the ethical, privacy, and security implications these technologies bring to the forefront.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced cybersecurity techniques, focusing on ethical hacking, digital forensics, and the latest in encryption technologies. My goal is to deepen my understanding of network security and threat intelligence to contribute to safer digital environments.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on projects aimed at enhancing online privacy and security. I'm especially interested in initiatives that aim to educate the public about safe digital practices, as well as projects that involve developing or testing new security tools and solutions.
